## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass nested properties

### Continued development

I would like to learn about having further clarity about when to use rem units vs pixels especially when it comes to spacing. I find it easier to undersdtand when and why to use rem vs pixels when it comes to font sizes, but less about when to use rem for spacing of elements with padding & margins.
